# JavaScript30 – Practice Projects

> **Learning Repository**  
> This repo contains my daily projects for the **JavaScript30** challenge by Wes Bos (30 projects in 30 days).  
>  
> These projects are **for learning purposes** only — quick builds to explore JavaScript concepts and APIs.  
> For my polished, production-ready projects, please see my [portfolio site](www.toddmoussallem.com).

## How This Repo Is Organized

- Each day’s project lives in its own folder:  
  `01-drum-kit`, `02-clock`, `03-css-variables`, etc.
- Each project has:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - 'script.js'
